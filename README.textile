This is a fork of João Moreno's Thyme app.

Thyme is a status bar application for OS X which allows you to time your tasks.
The app is *exactly* the same as João Moreno's one except that I've disabled the
Ctrl-T keyboard shortcut because it interfered with other apps' shortcuts
(e.g. Emacs).


h2. Instructions

# Open the application.
# Notice Thyme's icon in your OS X status bar; choose Start to begin timing.
# Timing sessions will be recorded and listed on the menu; press Clear to remove all sessions from the menu.
